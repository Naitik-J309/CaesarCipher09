# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation

This repository contains a simple yet functional implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** written in Python. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques, where each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number of positions.

## 🧠 What is the Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:
Plaintext:  A B C D E F G
Ciphertext: D E F G H I J 

It's a great starting point for understanding classical encryption techniques.

## 📜 Features

- Two modes:
  - **Encrypt**: Convert plain text into cipher text using a custom shift value.
  - **Decrypt**: Convert cipher text back to the original plain text.
- Supports both **uppercase and lowercase** letters.
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters (punctuation, digits, etc.) and keeps them unchanged.
- Simple command-line interaction.
